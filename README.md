simple doctor AI that's free

This script is just a simple doctor that I made in small amount of time. Some stuff doesn’t work because there is problem with counting EMS in service, I will work on that. But for now its pretty easy to know what is there and what isn’t! Its using motiontext and mythic_notify. I will post links for you to download them. Be free to use it and change however you want. But if you improve something let me know or post it in the comment so I can improve the code too and others too!

Dependencies:

motiontext

mythic_notify

And that’s all! I hope some people can tell me how I can improve it!

You have everything in config.lua. Well… almost everything. text and other stuff you can change easily in client/main.lua. If you find any bugs let me know! Thanks!

And also its using esx_ambulancejob from esx_framework(sorry :frowning: ) but you can change coordinates in config.lua so good luck.
